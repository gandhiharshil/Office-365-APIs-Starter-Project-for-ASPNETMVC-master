        This sample uses the <strong><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/office365/howto/platform-development-overview">Office 365 API</a></strong> client libraries to illustrate basic operations against the Calendar, Contacts, Mail, and Files (OneDrive for Business)
        service endpoints in Office 365. It also demonstrates how to enable single sign-on and authenticate against multiple Office 365 services
        in your app.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>To get started:</p>
    <br />
    <ol>
        <li><p>Select Sign in from the upper right corner of this page to sign in to your Office 365 tenant.</p></li>
        <li><p>Select the buttons below to see this app in action.</p></li>
    </ol>
            
    <br />
    <br />
    <p>The readme file is in the solution (README.MD), and you can also view it online at <strong><a href="http://aka.ms/o365-apis-start-aspnet">Office 365 Starter Project Readme. </a></strong></p>

    <p><strong>It is critical that all the Office 365 service permissions are configured properly in this sample as detailed in the sample readme. Failure to do so may cause authentication and functionality issues within this app.</strong></p>
